# Developing-a-portable-device-for-purification-of-water-using-a-bio-based-membrane
This project develops a bio-based membrane using fruit peel polymers (orange, lemon, banana) to remove dyes and heavy metals from textile wastewater. Optimized with Aspen PLUS, it ensures strength, permeability, and sustainability. Shortlisted for IIChE-CHEMATHON 2025.
My roles in this project include:
•	Assisted the group leader in coordinating research and development tasks.
•	Communicated with faculty members for project approval, guidance, and budget estimation.
•	Facilitated the acquisition of necessary technologies and materials for membrane fabrication.
•	Helped resolve both internal team challenges and external project hurdles to ensure smooth progress.
•	Coordinated with other teams from Lovely Professional University to visit Tamil Nadu for the event.
Learning outcomes from this project:
	Enhanced technical expertise in membrane fabrication and analytical techniques.
	Developed leadership and problem-solving skills by assisting in project management.
	Strengthened communication and collaboration through faculty interactions.
	Gained hands-on experience in wastewater treatment technologies and process optimization.
